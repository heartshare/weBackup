rdiff-backup BASH script is a little script I wrote to perform backup operation easily.

== Host / Destination configuration
The script is developed to be used with a single "Backuper" host that pull data from several servers.

== Backup & Restore
Actually only backup function is implemented.

Restore is a little bit more difficult: in my case the "backuper" is in a LAN, and cannot be accessed directly. In this case the operation ( reported from rdiff-backup mailing list ) consist in several steps: 
- restore to a local position
- scp to remote position
