  1. See "HOW TO - HOW IT WORKS" before next step
5. Copy "configure.tpl" to "configure" and edit file accord to your
	needs
6. Put inside "conf" directory files related to host you want to backup
7. Run script
	./backup.sh [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
	See ./backup.sh -h

 
HOW TO - HOW IT WORKS
---------------------
To let rdiff-backup perform backups, a ssh access to the machine that 
needs backup must be provided. rdiff-backup use 'root' account to
connect using ssh ( and this cannot be changed ) so the best way to
accomplish this is enabling ssh login to root accont on server only 
with ssh keys ( disabling access with password )


HOW TO - HOST SPECIFICATION
---------------------------
Files inside "conf" directory must be written in a specific way:
 - name of the file must match the host name you want to backup
	( is used to connect to host via ssh )
 - inside every file specify a list on new-line separated folders
	with absolute path
	
Example:
	host: subdomain.example.org
	
	file name: subdomain.example.org
	file content:
		/home
		/var/log
		/etc
