This is a ChangeLog...almost. We track only big changes in help
of our poor memory. So don't expect a lot of infos here ;)

We've switched to heirloom-mailx from postfix because mailx
is lighter than hell, it doesn't need system configuration, it
takes a bunch of directives directly from CLI; so it suits best
in scripts. Even more it is present in almost all distribuition. 
Overall we've pushed some sweet new code in the mail sender
function, so that it handle sending mail with external SMTP with authentication out of the box. If configuration is present in "configure" file

  #EXTERNAL SMTP CONFIGS
  SMTP_HOST=""
  SMTP_USER=""
  SMTP_PASSWORD=""
  SMTP_AUTH=""

they will be used. We encourage you to use them and not relay on the local system sender.
